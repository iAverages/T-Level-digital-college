# Using Matplotlib with Data

Download the data file linked below (this is the same data file that was used in the Starter Activity, so if you already have it then there is no need to download it again).

If you review the data by opening the file in Excel you will see it contains workout data, with columns labelled Duration, Pulse, Maxpulse and Calories.

Use what you have learnt so far in this lesson to produce some visualisations of this data using Pandas and Matplotlib.

Capture evidence of your visualisations and add them, along with your code to your OneNote page.

(It may be best to put the code and corresponding visualisations in a Word document and then attach that to your OneNote page. Remember that when pasting code into your Word document you might find it easier to read if you change the font to a fixed-width font like Courier New or Consolas.)
