# My First Plot

Create a short piece of code that will use Matplotlib to plot a line from (1, 3) to (8, 10). When complete copy your code to your OneNote page along with the accompanying graph, captured using Snip & Sketch or the Snipping Tool.

HINT: You might want to look at the code snippet above and use that as a starting point.
