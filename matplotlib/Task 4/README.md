# ESP 4a Redo

Return to the code that you produced for the recent mock ESP task 4a and rewrite it to produce visualisations of the data using Matplotlib.

Remember that the requirement is for the solution to also identify trends and patterns over time for the value of the pound (GBP) to the US dollar (USD) and the value of the US Dollar (USD) to the pound (GBP). The also part suggests to me that this should be a secondary function of the program, separate to the currency conversions and should be implemented as such.
