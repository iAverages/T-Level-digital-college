# Activity 3

You have been asked by a local fast food company to produce a prototype for a new point of sale system. The system will have no keys, but will use a touch screen with buttons to select all items. A separate till will be used for taking the payment, so this system is for ordering only. When items are selected and sale completed, a summary of the order will be sent to the kitchen and a total price will be sent to the till
